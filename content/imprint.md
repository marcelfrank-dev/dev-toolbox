As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to general laws (§ 7 para. 1 TMG). However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected.

If we become aware of any such infringements, we will remove this content immediately.

The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.
